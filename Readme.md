## Todo
* support inner reference, inner link can take to that article
* refactor templates
* fix image download

## Is this gem what you want?
There is an alternative gem called [kindlerb](https://github.com/danchoi/kindlerb) can generate mobi books, the gem is also used
for the website [KindleFeeder](http://kindlefeeder.com/) which is built by [Daniel Choi](http://danielchoi.com/software).

If you like to generate mobi book by some html files, you have to conform to the structure which author provide. But if you just
want to generate mobi book in the fly, then you should try this gem.

BTW, we share the same internal way to generating mobi book by [KindleGen 2](http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&docId=1000234621).
